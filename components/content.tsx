                I&apos;m a <em>seasoned engineer</em> who specializes in the
                craft&nbsp;of delivering polished softwares and memorable user
                experiences.

                I enjoy the challenge in tackling complex customer issues
                through technological means, encompassing the entire journey
                from planning to delivery using a data-driven approach.
